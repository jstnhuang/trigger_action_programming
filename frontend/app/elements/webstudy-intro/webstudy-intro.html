            <p>Welcome to our study on programming rules for a smart home.</p>
            <p>This study will take about 20 minutes to complete. Please only do the study once.</p>
            <p>We are evaluating an interface for making smart home rules. In this study, you will be asked to either:
              <ol>
                <li>Create rules for a smart home, to achieve a desired behavior, or</li>
                <li>Answer a question about an existing set of rules.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>Imagine you have a smart home.</p>
            <p>
              This smart home has computer-controlled devices like automatic lights, an automatic coffee-brewer,
              a computer-controlled front door lock, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              The smart home also has sensors, that allow it to know things like the current weather conditions,
              your current location, and whether motion has been detected inside the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assume that the smart home is capable of doing all the sensing and all the actions shown in the interface.

            <p>
              For some of the questions, there is not necessarily a "right" or "wrong" answer. However, for some questions, there is
              only one correct answer. Getting these questions wrong might invalidate your HIT, so please answer carefully.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you finish a question, you can't go back to change it. Do not click the back button in your browser; otherwise,
              you will have to start over.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you finish all the questions, you will be given a survey code. Copy this survey code back into Mechanical Turk
              to get credit for this HIT.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks!
